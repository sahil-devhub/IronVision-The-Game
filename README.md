# IronVision-The-Game
Engineered a real-time, motion-controlled game that translates physical movements (punches and kicks) into on-screen actions.

Developed the core system using computer vision with MediaPipe Pose and OpenCV to detect gestures, which are then mapped to in-game controls via PyAutoGUI.
